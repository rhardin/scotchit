Statistical analysis of [reddit.com/r/scotch](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/) Scotch ratings.

You may want to obtain a new copy of the spreadsheet from the sidebar at [reddit.com/r/scotch](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/).

I use this as a survey of Scotchit's ratings to make recommendations on scotch to try.

Here's an example output:

* Glenfarclas 40: 69% (11+, 11#) $$$$$
* Laphroaig CÃ irdeas Portwood: 67% (25+, 29#) $$$
* Ardbeg Uigeadail: 62% (73+, 100#) $$$
* Aberlour A'bunadh batch #36: 61% (8+, 8#) $$
* Benrinnes 23: 58% (7+, 7#) $$$$$
* Benrinnes 14 AD Rattray Sherry Cask: 54% (6+, 6#) $$$$
* Macallan Sherry Cask Strength: 51% (39+, 60#) $$$
* Lagavulin 12: 50% (23+, 33#) $$$$
