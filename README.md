Statistical analysis of [reddit.com/r/scotch](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/) Scotch ratings

You may want to obtain a new copy of the spreadsheet at [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsnkEzAVwhUVdF91M3R1NFdvQWYwY1JEeHNpNnZCbVE&output=csv)

I use this as a survey of Scotchit's ratings to make recommendations on scotch to try.

Here's an example output:
Aberlour 12 Non Chill Filtered: [46.72340343669602, 19]
Aberlour 16 Year Cask Strength: [28.47426584820678, 2]
Aberlour 18: [21.08662723731632, 5]
Aberlour A'bunadh batch #30: [28.47426584820678, 2]
Aberlour A'bunadh batch #36: [61.42559863245448, 8]
Aberlour A'bunadh batch #45: [23.757650032665786, 5]

Where the first number is a confidence score and the second number is the sample size.
